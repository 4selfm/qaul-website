Description: |
    **qaul.net** is a free software suite,
    which enables everyday devices, such as laptops and smartphones
    to create an internet independent **decentralised and open**
    ad-hoc wireless mesh network.
    It supports both public and private text messaging, voice calls,
    audio broadcasts and file sharing â€” all in a single app.

    Independent of existing wireless and celular infrastructure,
    it empowers users to share ideas and organise, circumventing
    government surveillence and censorship.

    In addition to this, it provides a powerful service library,
    which enables others to write applications that communicate
    and interact with an existing qaul network.
