The `qaul - قول` App does not collect any personal data.

The `qaul - قول` App does not share any personal data with third parties.

The `qaul - قول` App uses `background execution` permissions in order to receive and send messages when the app is running in the background.

The `qaul - قول` App uses `location permissions` and `background location permission` on older Android devices in order to communicate via `Bluetooth Low Energy`, even when the app is running in the background. This is due to a missing separation between bluetooth permissions and location permissions. Only bluetooth is used, the location is not used by the app at all.
